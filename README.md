I recently wanted to upload some HTML books to my Kindle. Disappointed by the way Calibre handles HTML files, I decided to make a script that would convert them to an appropriate format on my own.

## Contents

* A Gentle Introduction to Haskell ([Source](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/)) ([EPUB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_sU33gr527ZWnlxV3BaaWZmd0U/view?usp=sharing)) ([MOBI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_sU33gr527ZdlkwTE02MklPTWM/view?usp=sharing))
* Real World Haskell (WIP) ([Source](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)) ([EPUB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_sU33gr527ZOUxTRTlmY0J2c28/view?usp=sharing)) ([MOBI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_sU33gr527ZN3RCN0FGeUxpbkE/view?usp=sharing))

## Disclaimer

This code was made just for fun, with little respect for best practices. Among other horrors, you may find here

* bash files over 10 lines long
* [parsing HTML with regex](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454)
* poor attempts at functional decomposition
* Not Invented Here syndrome

etc.
